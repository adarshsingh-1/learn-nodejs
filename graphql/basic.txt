The Over-Fetching Problem

The Issue
When a user only needs one data field like created_by or email, sending all user data is wasteful.


Problems This Creates
Unnecessary data transfer
Increased bandwidth usage
Slower response times
Security concerns (exposing sensitive data)


for example:
User wants: just the email
Database returns: name, email, password, phone, address, created_by, etc.
Result: 90% wasted data transfer


Solution: Field Selection
Only fetch what you need from the database.


Benefits
Faster responses
Less bandwidth used
Better security
Improved performance



What does GraphQL Do?
Client specifies exactly what data it needs.
if the Client need title the server will return only title.
