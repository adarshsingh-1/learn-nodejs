If we are building a realtime chat application 

there are two options 

the client can ping the server at regular intervals to check for new messages this is called polling.


or the server can push new messages to the client as they arrive. this is called server-sent events or websockets.

Upgrade Header
The HTTP Upgrade request and response header can be used to upgrade an already-established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, or an HTTP(S) connection to a WebSocket connection.


Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
